# Contributing

Terrific, you want to contribute to cszb-scoreboard!

At this point, the project is small enough that there aren't a ton of rules. Please try your best to
make your code looks like it belongs. We use the Google code style for C++. A commit will be
auto-run via Jenkins, so it should pass tests. Likewise, code should plan to run on multiple
platforms, so please don't write anything that blatantly ignores that concept. That said, if you
write something which has small issues, it's better to send a pull request rather than fret about
it, and clean-up can happen later.
