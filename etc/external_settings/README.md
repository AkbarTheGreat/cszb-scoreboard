This directory holds CMakeSettings files for other projects, as a reference for how they're built to
support the scoreboard.

Currently, there are only two files, WxWidgetSettings.json and wxWidgetsCMakePresets.json, both of
which are copies of my (akbar's) CMakeSettings.json/CMakePresets.json to build wxWidgets in Visual
Studio/VsCode (respectively). Likely, you can use the presets file for either.
